# PyDodge-A_Python_Game
A simple dodging game using python.
 Imagine: The nearest planet from earth has exploded into chaos, the sky has fallen and broken pieces of the dead planet from the space are falling like rain. Now you, an intellectual lifeform in the shape of a little red square- have to dodge those evil- blue space particles to survive. The more you avoid them the fater they fall. Better keep an eye up and get movin
